# DNN-based-BPSK-QPSK-demodulation-on-RFSoC
The core objective of this project is to design and implement a QPSK/BPSK demodulation system using
a DNN at the receiver end, thereby replacing conventional demodulation methods with a machine
learning-based approach. This shift in methodology is motivated by the need for demodulation
techniques that not only exhibit robustness but also possess the adaptability required to meet the
dynamic demands of modern communication systems.
The implementation of this novel demodulation system is facilitated by the Zynq UltraScale
RFSoC 4x2 board, a sophisticated platform that seamlessly integrates a processing system with
programmable logic. This integration offers a conducive environment to harness the power of
machine learning in demodulation tasks. The workflow of the project involves capturing signal
data from an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and feeding it into a pre-trained DNN model
deployed within the RFSoC 4x2 architecture.
